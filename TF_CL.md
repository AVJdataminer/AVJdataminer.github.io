Hello Thinkful,
	I am writing to express my interest in joining Thinkful in developing the best in class remote, full-time data science program as a Data Science Curriculum Writer. I am an experienced machine learning practitioner, with a knack for leveraging data to derive actionable information for business solutions. I have been applying advanced statistical methods and machine learning models for over 10 years in various fields such as remote sensing, insurance, and health care. Not only do I have a strong background in data science, but I have also remained an active learner and educator throughout my path. Early in my career, I co-authored a reference book and taught the principles of remote sensing data science to resource managers. I further developed my interest in education by teaching graduate and undergraduate courses while in graduate school at Montana State University, where I also learned the fundamentals of pedagogy in a graduate-level education course. Additionally, I was an instructor for a GIS course at the University of Montana-Western.
Last summer, I served as a volunteer expert with the Financial Services Volunteer Corp in Tunisia in support of their recent open data initiative. I identified high-value data for the Tunisian government that aligned with their goals, and presented data governance topics to various government entities and officials. I also developed data science workshops for the Tunisian government to foster hands-on training and to promote data access and reuse, to continue data science education for their government employees going forward.
My unmatched passion for implementing machine learning and artificial intelligence has led me to pursue mentoring opportunities with online data science boot-camps as well as through my own Data Science company. These experiences led me to the realization that many aspiring data scientists don't have a model to follow for the trajectory of a data science project. Thus I developed theÂ Data Science Method, a methodological framework for how to approach any data science problem.
In addition to mentoring the next generation of data scientists, I have pursued opportunities to create data science curriculum including creating content for individuals and online data science platforms, select examples include:
Exponent Data Science Content
Guided Capstone Step 2 Project Notebook
Plural Site EDA in R Certification
Colab Python Project Starter Notebook

Consequently, I have a breadth of experience and have excellent verbal and written communication abilities and people management skills. Regardless of my position, I have benefitted from many educational opportunities, and I am intricately aware of the positive impact a well-thought out education path is to the development of an aspiring data scientist. I am energized and humbled by the opportunity to help millions of students worldwide change their lives through data science education.
Please feel free to contact me to discuss my application further or to trade the latest outdoor adventure stories, and thank you for considering me for this exciting position.
Sincerely,
Aiden V. Johnson
