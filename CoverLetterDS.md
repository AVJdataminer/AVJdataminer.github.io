Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in your Senior Data Scientist role. I am an experienced machine learning practitioner, with a knack for leveraging data to derive actionable information for business solutions.

This is what I do:
- Lead the design, development, implementation, and documentation of predictive modeling solutions that drive growth and add value to your business enterprises.
- Identify, develop, and implement practical decision data science solutions like predictive regression modeling, decision trees, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.


These are what I use:

:wrench: R, Python, SQL, PySpark, Keras, Tensorflow, Linux, AWS.


This is how I am unique:

- Proven flexibility and adaptability through continued skills acquistion and development.
- Provide technical and professional development to aspiring data scientists via mentoring for several online data science bootcamps.

Here are some examples of my data work on [Github](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/):

•  [Data Science Project Review Framework](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Model_Review_Methods)

• [Callable Random Forest Regression Model in python](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/WH)

• [Predicting sensor failure with Mxnet Neural Network Model in R](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Sensor)

• [R package to implement all pre-processing steps in data science projects.](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Squeaky)  

Additionally, I have developed the [Data Science Method](https://medium.com/@aiden.dataminer/the-data-science-method-dsm-data-collection-organization-and-definitions-d19b6ff141c4) on standardizing the approach to data science projects.

Please feel free to contact me to discuss my application further, and thank you for considering me for this exciting position.

Sincerely,
