Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in your Director of Content role. I am an experienced machine learning practitioner, with a knack for leveraging data to derive actionable information for business solutions.  I have been applying advanced statistical methods for over 10 years in various fields such as remote sensing, insurance, and health care. Not only do I have a strong background in fundamental statistics, but I also have experience with many different programming languages and software packages including: R, Python, SPSS, SAS, Matlab, ArcGIS, AMR, Java, eCognition, MySQL, SQL, and Erdas Imagine.

Moreover, I have been in a variety of positions, from being a research assistant to a modeler to a data scientist on a Machine Learning Team. These positions have been at a large university to a state agency to a Fortune 500 company and have given me a breadth of experience in communicating my findings to the general public as well as upper level management teams. Consequently, I have developed excellent verbal and written communication and people management skills. Regardless of my position, I have benefitted from having a mentor and thus am intricately aware of the positive impact a strong, empathetic mentor is to the development of a new data scientist. 

Overall, I am a highly driven individual and data scientist and I know that I can serve as an excellent Content Director for DataQuest. I believe in continued adaptation through continuous skills acquisition and broadening knowledge, which I know translates well to being a new data scientist. I am the ideal candidate for this position because of my:
Experience working with large complex digital data sets,
Advanced statistical knowledge,
Strong code writing skills in: R, Matlab, Python, SQL,
Excellent communication skills, and
Organizational skills and professional conduct.

This is what I do:
- Lead the design, development, implementation, and documentation of predictive modeling solutions that drive growth and add value to your business enterprises.
- Identify, develop, and implement practical decision data science solutions like predictive regression modeling, decision trees, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

These are what I use:  

:wrench: R, Python, SQL, PySpark, Keras, Tensorflow, Linux, AWS.


This is how I am unique:

- Proven flexibility and adaptability through continued skills acquistion and development.
- Provide technical and professional development to aspiring data scientists via mentoring for several online data science bootcamps.

Here are some examples of my data work on [Github](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/):  
•  [Data Science Project Review Framework](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Model_Review_Methods)  
• [Callable Random Forest Regression Model in python](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/WH)  
• [Predicting sensor failure with Mxnet Neural Network Model in R](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Sensor)  
• [R package to implement all pre-processing steps in data science projects.](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Squeaky)    

Additionally, I have developed the [Data Science Method](https://medium.com/@aiden.dataminer/the-data-science-method-dsm-data-collection-organization-and-definitions-d19b6ff141c4) on standardizing the approach to data science projects.

Please feel free to contact me to discuss my application further, and thank you for considering me for this exciting position.

Sincerely,
