Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Director of Content role. I am an experienced machine learning practitioner, with a knack for leveraging data to derive actionable information for business solutions.  I have been applying advanced statistical methods for over ten years in various fields such as remote sensing, insurance, and health care. Not only do I have a strong background in data science, but I have also remained an active learner and educator throughout my path. Early in my career, I co-authored a [reference book](https://www.fs.fed.us/eng/rsac/programs/monitoringforests/10018-RPT1-Book%201.pdf) and taught the principles of remote sensing data science to resource managers.  Later while in graduate school at Montana State University I further developed my interest in education by teaching graduate and undergraduate courses and learning the fundamentals of pedagogy in a graduate-level education course. Additionally, I was an instructor for a GIS course at the University of Montana-Western.  Currently, I serve as a mentor for several online data camps, and I have written and developed the [Data Science Method](https://medium.com/@aiden.dataminer/the-data-science-method-dsm-data-collection-organization-and-definitions-d19b6ff141c4) on standardizing the approach to data science projects.

Moreover, I have been in a variety of positions, from being a research assistant to a statistical modeler to a data scientist. These positions have been at a large university to a state agency to a Fortune 500 company and most recently a startup, and have given me a breadth of experiences. Consequently, I have developed excellent verbal and written communication abilities and people management skills. Regardless of my position, I have benefitted from many educational opportunities, and thus I am intricately aware of the positive impact a well mapped out education path is to the development of an aspiring data scientist.

Overall, I am a highly driven individual with solid communication and collaboration skills, and I know that I can serve as an excellent Content Director for Data Quest. I believe in continued adaptation through continuous skills acquisition and broadening my knowledge, which translates well to being an outstanding leader. I am energized and humbled by the opportunity to help millions of students worldwide change their lives through data science education.

I am the ideal candidate for this position because of my:
* Experience teaching traditional and non-traditional students,
* Excellent communication, collaboration, and leadership skills,
* Experience formulating strategy and developing broader company goals,
* Vast experience as a Data Scientist in many industries.

Here are some examples of my data work on [Github](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/):  
• [Data Science Project Review Framework](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Model_Review_Methods)  
• [Callable Random Forest Regression Model in python](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/WH)  
• [Predicting sensor failure with Mxnet Neural Network Model in R](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Sensor) 

Please feel free to contact me to discuss my application further, and thank you for considering me for this exciting position.

Sincerely,
