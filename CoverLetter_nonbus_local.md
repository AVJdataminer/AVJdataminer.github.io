Hi!  

I am writing to express my interest in serving your organization.  I am an experienced machine learning practitioner, with a knack for leveraging data to derive actionable information for business solutions. With over 10 years of experience in a variety of industries, I have a broad background and the adaptability to match any data challenge.

This is what I do:  
- Lead the design, development, implementation, and documentation of predictive modeling solutions that drive growth and add value to your organization.  
- Identify, develop, and implement practical decision data science solutions like predictive regression modeling, decision trees, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

These are what I use: R, Python, SQL, PySpark, Keras, Tensorflow, Linux, AWS.

This is how I am unique:  
- Proven flexibility and adaptability through continued skills acquisition and development.  
- Provide technical and professional development to aspiring data scientists by mentoring for several top ranked online data science bootcamps.

Here are some examples of my data work on [Github](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/):  
- [Data Science Project Review Framework](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Model_Review_Methods)  
- [Callable Random Forest Regression Model in python](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/WH)  
- [Predicting sensor failure with Mxnet Neural Network Model in R](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Sensor)     

Additionally, I have developed the [Data Science Method](https://medium.com/@aiden.dataminer/the-data-science-method-dsm-data-collection-organization-and-definitions-d19b6ff141c4), which focuses on standardizing the approach to data science projects.on standardizing the approach to data science projects.

Please feel free to contact me to discuss my application further, and thank you for considering me for this exciting position.

Sincerely,  

Aiden V. Johnson
