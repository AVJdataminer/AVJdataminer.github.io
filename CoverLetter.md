Hi there,

I am writing to express my interest in serving your organization.  I am an experienced machine learning practitioner, with a knack for leveraging data to derive actionable information for business solutions. With over ten years of experience in many industries I have a broad background and adaptability to match any data driven challenge.

This is what I do:  
- Lead the design, development, implementation, and documentation of predictive modeling solutions that drive growth and add value to your organization.
- Identify, develop, and implement practical decision data science solutions like predictive regression modeling, decision trees, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.


These are what I use:

:wrench: R, Python, SQL, PySpark, Keras, Tensorflow.


This is how I am unique:

- Proven flexibility and adaptability through continued skills acquistion and development.
- Provide technical and professional development to aspiring data scientists via mentoring for several top ranked online data science bootcamps.
- Experience teaching and communicating data science to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Here are some examples of my work on Github:

• [Python tool to create timecard from Google Calendar](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Gtools)

• [R package to implement all pre-processing steps in data science projects.](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Squeaky)   

• [Predicting sensor failure with Mxnet Neural network Model in R](https://github.com/AVJdataminer/Sensor)

Here is a series I am writing on standardizing the Data Science project approach:

 - [The Data Science Method](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-data-science-method-dsm-a-framework-on-how-to-take-your-data-science-projects-to-the-next-91f9fd81e5d1)


Please feel free to contact me to discuss my application further, and thank you for considering me for this exciting opportunity.

Sincerely,
